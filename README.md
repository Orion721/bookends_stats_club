## General info
This is a passion project to pull ultimate frisbee data from Ultiarchive.com and store it in a database.
The focus for this particular project is for the club division's regular season Triple Crown Tour events including postseason Nationals.
Eventually, there will be room to expand the project to include the college division and the full postseason series.
The end goal is to learn more about data transformation, data storage and eventually building a webapp connected to a databse.

## Technologies
* Python - version 3.6
* MySQL

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* Finish loading data into the MySQL database
* Build out a series of custom SQL script views for interface
* Build webapp that points to database so data can be viewed and manipulated
* Start work on an equivalent process for college ultimate frisbee stats

To-do list:
* Fixing pool_games file for efficiency and fix the dataframe
* Adding spirit scores to team_events table
* Fixing bracket_games for efficiency and adding in bracket game dates/times
* Refactor Python scripts for improved efficiency/readability

## Status
Project is: _in progress_

## Inspiration
Project inspired to teach myself the end-to-end basics of data ingestion, transformation, storage and display. 
The end goal of this project is to turn the skills and processes I learn into a long career in data and cloud engineering.
